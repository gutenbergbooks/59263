<p class="t0">Christians awake, salute the happy morn,</p>
<p class="t0">Whereon the <span class="sc">Saviour</span> of the world was born;</p>
<p class="t0">Rise to adore the mystery of Love,</p>
<p class="t0">Which hosts of angels chanted from above:</p>
<p class="t0">With them the joyful tidings first begun,</p>
<p class="t0">Of <span class="sc">God</span> Incarnate and the Virgin&rsquo;s <span class="sc">Son</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,</p>
<p class="t0">Who heard the angelic herald&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Behold,</p>
<p class="t0">I bring glad tidings of a <span class="sc">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> birth,</p>
<p class="t0">To you and all the nations upon earth;</p>
<p class="t0">This day hath <span class="sc">God</span> fulfilled his promised word,</p>

<p class="t0">Wrapt up in swaddling clothes, the Babe divine</p>
<p class="t0">Lies in a manger&mdash;this shall be your sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">He spake, and straightway the celestial choir</p>
<p class="t0">In hymns of joy unknown before conspire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The praises of redeeming love they sung,</p>
<p class="t0">And heaven&rsquo;s whole arch with hallelujahs rung!</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">God&rsquo;s</span> highest glory was their anthem still,</p>
<p class="t0">Peace upon earth, and mutual good will.</p>

<p class="t0">From his poor manger to his bitter cross;</p>

<p class="t0">Around us all his glory shall display:</p>
<p class="t0">Sav&rsquo;d by his love, incessant we shall sing</p>

<p class="t0">Jesus, the God whom angels fear,</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
